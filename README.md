## Introduction

Network attacks pose significant threats to online systems and services, potentially leading to service disruptions, data breaches, and more. Understanding how these attacks work and implementing effective mitigation strategies is crucial for maintaining the integrity and availability of network resources.

This repository aims to provide clear explanations and practical demonstrations of SYN Flood and Ping of Death attacks, as well as steps to mitigate these threats.

## SYN Flood Attack

### How SYN Flood Attacks Work

A SYN Flood attack exploits the TCP handshake process to overwhelm a target server, causing denial of service. The attacker floods the server with SYN packets, leaving open ports waiting for the final ACK packet, which never arrives. This exhausts resources and hinders normal functionality.

### Importance of SYN Flood Mitigation

SYN Flood attacks can disrupt services, slow down server responses, and deny access to legitimate users. The consequences include lost business opportunities, damage to critical infrastructure, and reputation loss.

### Mitigation Strategies

Several strategies can mitigate SYN Flood attacks:
- Increasing the backlog queue to handle more half-open connections.
- Recycling the oldest half-open TCP connection to free resources.
- Using SYN cookies to manage connection requests without filling the backlog queue.

## Ping of Death Attack

### How Ping of Death Attacks Work

The Ping of Death attack sends oversized ICMP ping packets to crash or freeze a target system. When fragmented packets are reassembled, a buffer overflow occurs, causing the system to crash.

### Mitigation Approaches

Mitigating Ping of Death attacks involves:
- Blocking fragmented ping packets.
- Increasing memory buffers to prevent overflow.
- Utilizing DDoS protection services to filter malicious packets.

## Tools Used

- Command Line
- Wireshark

## Screenshots and Commands

The repository includes screenshots and commands demonstrating the execution of SYN Flood and Ping of Death attacks using tools like Wireshark, Command Line, and more.
